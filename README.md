# DSTV Reader
DSTV Reader is a Python library for parsing and analyzing DSTV (NC/NC1) files commonly used in the structural steel industry.
It allows easy extraction of profile information, detection of inclined cuts, and basic automation of file classification.

## Features
Parse DSTV files and extract profile headers and geometry

Detect inclined cuts on flanges and webs

Classify and sort NC files based on detected features

Modular structure: easy to extend or integrate into larger workflows

## Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serg-you-lin/DSTVParser.git
```

## Requirements
Python 3.9+

No external dependencies (for now)

To install dependencies in the future:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Notes
This project is under active development.
Supporting .nc1 files will be ready soon (just print header now).
Plotting and DXF export features will be added in the future.

# How to Use
## Basic example
```bash
from DSTVParser import NCFileParser

nc_file = "your_file.nc"
parser = NCFileParser(str(nc_file))
profile = parser.parse()

print(profile.get_header())
```
For a complete example, see RunExample.py.

## Example use case: Split Profiles by feature
One common use case is to split NC profiles based on profile type or specific geometric characteristics, such as the presence of holes or inclined cuts.

```bash
from DSTVParser import NCFileParser

input_folder = "your_folder"
sets_by_type = {}

for file_path in input_folder.glob("*.nc"):
    try:
        parser = NCFileParser(str(file_path))
        profile = parser.parse()
        profile_type = profile.code_profile

        if profile_type not in sets_by_type:
            sets_by_type[profile_type] = []

        sets_by_type[profile_type].append(file_path.name)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to process {file_path.name}: {e}")

# Print grouped profiles
for profile_type, files in sets_by_type.items():
    print(f"{profile_type}:", len(files))
```

You can find an example of such usage in:
```bash
Examples/isolate_inclined_cuts.py
```
This script:
- Scans a folder containing .nc files
-Parses each file using the NCFileParser
-Checks for inclined flange/web cuts
-Copies the file into either the Inclined cuts or Straights folder, accordingly
